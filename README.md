## Abstract <a name="abstract"></a>

Schizophrenia is a polygenic and heritable severe mental disorder. It has been associated with social isolation and loneliness in previous research by a bidirectional causal relationship. Loneliness is a known cause for the onset and worsening of mental disorders as well as a risk factor for mortality. 

In this study, a multidisciplinary approach is taken to study the association between loneliness and psychosis with the use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data. Three main bioinformatics analyses are performed including polygenic risk score estimation, genomic structural equation modelling and gene-environment interaction analysis. The objective is to replicate the association found in previous literature in a European cohort. We further advance this objective by studying the potential overlap at different stages of psychosis, including schizophrenia and first episode psychosis data. We also perform a genomic dissection methodology and a study of the interaction of several environmental variables with schizophrenia subjected to isolation. 

We find a statistically significant genetic overlap between social isolation and schizophrenia, indicating an association with later stages of psychosis. We as well find a gene-environment interaction between cannabis use and schizophrenia subjected to isolation. These results illustrate the application of bioinformatics tools in translational medicine research and their possible use for innovation in the clinical practice in the form of adequate socialization tools in the treatment of psychosis patients.
